# add-ten-app
This Java application takes a single numeric parameter **num** via the defined route, and returns a JSON object, with a single key **sum**, whose value is the sum of **num** and **10**.

For example, when the user attempts to make the following request:

http://www.myapp.com/7 

then the JSON response will return:

 {
   "sum": "17"
 }
